# Quantum-Random-Walks
Plots the PDF and frequency distribution of a quantum random walk upto 'n' steps, without measurement at immediate steps, using a Hadamard coin. The number of steps, 'n' and the number of trials (for the frequency distribution) are set initially; the code can be modified for these to be passed as inputs.

This code was produced to stimulate the quantum random walk, as illustrated in the paper 'Quantum Random Walks' by J. Kempe.
